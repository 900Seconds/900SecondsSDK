/**
 * AWSMobileAnalyticsEventClient is the entry point into the Mobile Analytics SDK where AWSMobileAnalyticsEvent objects are created,
 * recorded, and submitted to the Mobile Analytics Website.
 *
 * <h3>Recording Events</h3>
 * <p>
 * The example below demonstrates how to create and record events after retrieving an AIVariation. In this example,
 * the developer records the <em>\@"level1Complete"</em> event to represent a view, and if the user makes
 * a purchase, the developer records a <em>\@"level1UserBoughtUpgrade"</em> to represent a conversion.
 * </p>
 * Example:
 * @code
 * // get the event client from insights instance
 * id<AWSMobileAnalyticsEventClient> eventClient = insights.eventClient;
 *
 * // create the view event
 * id<AWSMobileAnalyticsEvent> level1Event = [eventClient createEventWithEventType:@"level1Complete"];
 *
 * // record the view event
 * [eventClient recordEvent:level1Event];
 *
 * // record if the user bought an upgrade (conversion)
 * if (userBoughtUpgrade) {
 *    // create the conversion event
 *    id<AWSMobileAnalyticsEvent> boughtUpgradeEvent = [eventClient createEventWithEventType:@"level1UserBoughtUpgrade"];
 *
 *    // record the conversion event
 *    [eventClient recordEvent:boughtUpgradeEvent];
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * <h3>Submitting Events</h3>
 * <p>
 * The example below demonstrates how to submit events to the Mobile Analytics Website.
 * The SDK will automatically attempt to submit events when the application goes into the background. If you want to explicitly submit events you can invoke the AWSMobileAnalyticsEventClient::submitEvents selector to submit events to the Mobile Analytics Website in a background thread.
 * </p>
 * Example:
 * @code
 * // get the event client from insights instance
 * id<AWSMobileAnalyticsEventClient> eventClient = insights.eventClient;
 *
 * // submit events to the website
 * [eventClient submitEvents];
 * @endcode
 * The SDK ensures that you do not submit events too frequently. If you try submitting events within one minute of a previous
 * submission, the submission request will be ignored.
