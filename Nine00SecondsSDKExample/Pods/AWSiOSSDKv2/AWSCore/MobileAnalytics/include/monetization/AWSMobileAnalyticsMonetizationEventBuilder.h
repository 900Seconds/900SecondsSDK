/**
 * Base class for handling the required attributes and metrics for monetization Events. This
 * class is not meant to be instantiated. Instead, create instances specific to the purchase
 * you are trying to record. Currently, AWSMobileAnalyticsVirtualMonetizationEventBuilder is used to create
 * monetization events for virtual purchases, and AWSMobileAnalyticsAppleMonetizationEventBuilder is used
 * to create monetization events for purchases with Apple's IAP framework.
 * 
 * This class can be extended if you need to record monetization events from other 
 * purchase frameworks. Derived classes must override the AWSMobileAnalyticsMonetizationEventBuilder::isValid
 * method so that AWSMobileAnalyticsMonetizationEventBuilder knows if the derived builder is in a valid state.
